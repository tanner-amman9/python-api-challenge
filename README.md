# python-api-challenge
In this challenge I pulled data from api's and then created dataframes. I then used the data to create scatterplots. After that I split the data into northern and southern hemispheres and then created a function to run a linear regression on all the previous scatterplots in the new format of northern and southern hemispheres. In the Vacatations challenge I used geoviews to map out the data onto their respective latitude and longitude points, and sized the points by humidity of that city. I then cleaned the data and put in my ideal weather choices to find hotels nearest to those points. I then used the geoapify api and found the nearest hotel within 10000 meters of the location. I then plotted those locations on the map and added in the hotels and country into each points hover bar.

In the WeatherPy folder you will find the code for both WeatherPy and VacationPy.
In the Output_Data folder you will find the csv file formed from WeatherPy and the first 4 scatterplots from WeatherPy.
